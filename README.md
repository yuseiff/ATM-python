ATM

A simulator for an ATM machine written in Python would be a program that mimics the functionality of a real-world ATM machine. The program would allow users to interact 
with the simulated ATM through a user interface, such as a command line interface or a graphical user interface. The program would be able to handle various ATM 
transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and account balance inquiries. Additionally, the program could include features such as security measures, 
such as password protection, to ensure the privacy and security of user information.

the project included the ability to change the password and storage any change in account or password in a files.
